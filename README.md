# ExactSimulation
This branch gives the simulation algorithms for the 
model of competitive populations with trait dynamics following a feller type diffusion introduced in the article
'Exact simulation algorithm for individual-based population models', available on arxiv:
https://arxiv.org/pdf/#####.pdf

The `python` implementation uses the classical libraries
`numpy`, `matplotlib`, `scipy` to be able 
to run on every setup.
